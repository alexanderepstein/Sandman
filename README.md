 Sandman will remind you to take a rest and that you can always come back to the work tomorrow.

A sleep cycle is a 90-minute chunk of time where your body transitions through various phases of sleep — all the way down to deep REM sleep — then back again. Some health experts believe that these 90-minute sleep cycles are the key to restful sleep. They recommend trying to sleep exactly 7.5 hours — or even 9 hours, if you have the time.


Based on your wakeup time and the sleep algorithm Sandman calculates the best times for you to sleep. It will notify you throughout the night when the optimal times to shutdown your computer and start to head to sleep and provide a button to do just that.

This application works well with https://justgetflux.com/

## In Action

![Usage](https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Sandman/blob/master/assets/Usage.gif)



## Install

### Mac
Homebrew casks are the preferred method of installations (easiest to upgrade Sandman with brew cask update)

#### Homebrew install
```bash
brew tap caskroom/cask # add homebrew casks if you havent already
brew update
brew install --cask sandman
```
#### Manual install
Download your respective platforms release from the downloads section.

Drag the Sandman.app from the Sandman dmg to the Applications folder. Double Clicking on the app should run it and it could be kept in the dock from here.

### Linux
Open up a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the downloaded installer files and run
#### Debian
First make sure you have the dependency libappindicator1
```bash
sudo apt-get install libappindicator1
```
then depending on your system architecture either run

```bash
sudo dpkg -i Sandman_1.9.2_amd64.deb
```
Or:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i Sandman_1.9.2_x86.deb
```
#### RedHat
```bash
sudo rpm -i Sandman.rpm
```
 This will actually install Sandman as a utility application which can be accessed from your respective distributions application launchpad.

## Helping Out
It is assumed you already have node installed and therefore npm.

To download the full source code and install the Dependencies run the following lines:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Sandman
cd Sandman
npm install
cd ..
npm start dev # this will run the application with all of the devtools open
```   

If you get some error and the application wont run try running the following lines and see if that works.

### Linux/Mac
```bash
cd Sandman
sudo npm install -g
```

### Windows
Right click on the start menu icon at the bottom left and click on the option to open a command prompt in developer mode
cd to the Sandman directory then run
```bash
npm install -g
```
### CSS Compilation

The app styling was made with: [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) `v3.3.14`  [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) `v2.3.1p112`.

 To compile the stylesheet you'll only need to run the following command:
 ```bash
 sass --watch scss:css --style compressed
 ```


### To Compile Source To Application

### Linux
Open a terminal to the Sandman directory
```bash
cd build
chmod a+x linux.sh
./linux.sh
```
This will build installers for Debian 32/64 bit and Redhat linux in the build/dist/installers folder

### Mac
Open a terminal to the Sandman directory
```bash
cd build
chmod a+x mac.sh
./mac.sh
```
This will build a dmg in the build folder

### Windows
Right click on the start menu icon at the bottom left and click on the option to open a command prompt in developer mode
then run
```bash
npm install -g electron-packager
```
Then once electron packager is installed to package your electron application open up a terminal and cd into the Sandman folder then run

For 64 Bit Binary:
```bash
electron-packager . Sandman --platform win32 --arch x64 --out dist/
```
For 32 Bit Binary
```bash
electron-packager . Sandman --platform win32 --arch ia32 --out dist/
```
