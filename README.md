 Insomnia will remind you to take a rest and that you can always come back to the work tomorrow.
 Inspired by http://sleepyti.me a website that calculates optimal times to fall asleep based on when you want to wake up.
 The idea is that when you wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle you will feel groggy, however if you wakeup during the
 transition between sleep cycles you will feel refreshed!
</div>

This application uses the averages that sleep cycles are 90 minutes each and a person takes 15 minutes to fall asleep from when they begin to try and calculates the times for you to sleep. It will notify you throughout the night when the optimal times to shutdown your computer and start to head to sleep and provide a button to do just that. This application works well with https://justgetflux.com/

# Downloads
To get the full sourced version run in terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Insomnia
```

Otherwise to just get the application download your respective platforms file from the list of download links below:
* [Debian Linux 32 Bit](https://goo.gl/bqXCmt)
* [Debian Linux 64 Bit](https://goo.gl/FbHvLh)
* [Mac OS 64 Bit](https://goo.gl/jMa9a5)
* [Windows 32 Bit](https://goo.gl/bB61tc)
* [Windows 64 Bit](https://goo.gl/NuzRQ0)

## Install

### Mac
Drag the Insomnia.app from the Insomnia dmg to the Applications folder. Double Clicking on the app should run it and it could be kept in the dock from here.

### Linux
Open up a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the downloaded installer files and run
```bash
sudo dpkg -i Insomnia_1.4.1_amd64.deb
```
Or:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i Insomnia_1.4.1_x86.deb
```

 This will actually install Insomnia as a utility application which can be accessed from your respective distributions application launchpad.

### Windows
Open up another windows explorer and navigate to your program files folder (x86 or 64 bit is irrelevant). Now drag the entire Insomnia Windows folder you extracted  from the downloaded zip in the previous step over to the program files folder. Go into the folder that was just dragged over and find the Insomnia.exe and run it. Now the application will show up in the dock where it can be pinned.

## Uninstall

### Mac
Go to the applications folder and delete the Insomnia application.

### Linux
Open up a terminal and run:
```bash
sudo dpkg --remove Insomnia
```

### Windows
Open up the program files folder and delete the Insomnia folder.

## Helping Out
It is assumed you already have node installed and therefore npm.

To download the full source code and install the devDependencies run the following lines:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexanderepstein/Insomnia
cd Insomnia
npm install
cd ..
electron Insomnia # this will run the application
```   

If you get some error and the application wont run try running the following lines and see if that works.

### Linux/Mac
```bash
cd Insomnia
sudo npm install -g
```

### Windows
Right click on the start menu icon at the bottom left and click on the option to open a command prompt in developer mode
cd to the insomnia directory then run
```bash
npm install -g
```

If you have a feature you would like to add or optimizations to the original code
* Feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request
* Add an issue labeled as an enhancement and if I think its a good idea I will do my best to implement it myself
